## Detailed Description of Key Directories and Files

### `core/`
Contains reusable components that can be shared among multiple projects:
- `base/`: Base classes such as `BaseTest` for test setup/teardown and `BasePage` for page objects.
- `driver/`: Manages Playwright browser driver initialization and configuration.
- `config/`: Handles reading configuration files and environment variables to determine browser, URLs, etc.
- `utils/`: Utility helper classes like wait handlers, file operations, and JSON processing.
- `enums/`: Enum definitions for fixed values like browser types and environment names to prevent errors.

### `locators/`
Contains locator (selector) definitions specific to each project.  
Typically organized by page or module, e.g., `LoginPageLocators.java` stores locators for the login page.

### `tests/`
Contains test cases organized by feature or module.  
For example, `login/LoginTest.java` contains login-related tests.

### `resources/`
- `config/`: Environment-specific configuration files (dev, staging, prod).
- `data/`: Test data files such as JSON or CSV used by tests.
- `testng.xml`: TestNG suite configuration file.

### `tools/`
Contains utility scripts and helper files outside main test code, e.g.:
- `InstallBrowser.java`: Script to install Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

### `reports/`
Folder where test execution reports are stored, including Allure and HTML reports.

## Recommendations
- Keep `core` (shared framework code) separate from `locators` and `tests` (project-specific code).
- Use enums in `core/enums` to reduce configuration errors.
- Maintain locators in the `locators` folder to simplify maintenance when the UI changes.
- Comment clearly in each file for easy maintenance and onboarding.

If you want, I can also generate sample code files or config templates for any part of this structure — just let me know!
